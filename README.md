## Excluding Yourself From Tracking Data
Go to [ontrackivf.com/exclude/](http://ontrackivf.com/exclude/) in order to set a cookie that will exclude you from the tracking data. You must do this on all devices you want to use.

You must also set the exclusion cookie separately for your dev environment. The url to do that will vary based on your setup. It might be [localhost/exclude/](http://localhost/exclude/).
